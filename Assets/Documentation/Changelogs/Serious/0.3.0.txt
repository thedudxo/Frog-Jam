Fixes:
- Phill doesn't get stuck on flat surfaces anymore
- Clouds would pop up/disappear without playing the animation properly
- So many bugs caused by adding multiplayer functionality

===============

Known Issues:
- music zones occasionaly get out of sync
- the music kinda sucks tbh
- Phill occasionaly launches forwards but not up whith particular timed jumps
- Aligaytors will sometimes be launched the other way from what you'd expect when you land on them. I think this is unity having some janky physics so I'm not sure I can fix this one properly
