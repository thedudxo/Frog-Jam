Fixes:

===============

Known Issues:
- music zones occasionaly get out of sync
- the music kinda sucks tbh
- Phill occasionaly launches forwards but not up whith particular timed jumps
- Clouds sometimes pop up without animating
- Aligaytors will sometimes be launched the other way from what you'd expect when you land on them. I think this is unity having some janky physics so i'm not sure i can fix this one properly.
