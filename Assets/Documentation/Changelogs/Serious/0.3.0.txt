0.3.0 - Jam with friend!

____________________

New Features:

 - Split screen multiplayer

 - Frogs have rotation physics, will try to remain upright.
 - Frogs are now slightly slippery. This allows chaining jumps for extra speed and distance
 - Tapping the jump key will always result in the smallest possible jump

 - Jumping animations
 - Jumping Sounds
 - Air particles when going fast

 - Aligaytors are now always friendly
 - Aligaytors have rotation physics
 - Aligaytors try to return to their starting position
 - Aligaytors will carry you along with them rather than having to keep up yourself

 - Splits start tracking time once you pass the previous one
 - End screen displays sum of your best splits. Ie, your best possible time
 - End screen displays current runs time, and your personal best run

 - It's now possible for multiple waves to spawn
 - There will always a wave somewhere behind each player in the level

 - A "In Danger" indicator, appears when you would respawn behind a wave
 - Any death while In danger will respawn at the start of the level

 - "Ghost mode" while players are on the start platform.
 - While in ghost mode:
	* Players cannot collide with other players
	* Players will not die to the wave

- The level timer doesn't begin until you leave the start platform

Changes:

- Camera has a max height
- Camera is positioned higher up and further right
- Camera pulls back as a wave approaches

- Grounded detection uses colliders again, has some "coyotie time"

- Refactored heaps of code

- Refined the level, so its shorter and has more interesting parts
	* Removed the "leap of faith" section
	* Reworked the aligaytor section
	* Removed repetitive log jumps
	* Feedback appreciated

- Fishing hole counts any death near it as a catch

- Waves don't get pushed back when you die
- It's possible to survive a wave by being above it as it passes. a new wave will be sent for you, however
- Waves won't harm you on the start platform

- Disabled music for various reasons:
	* Dynamic music doesn't make any sense in splitscreen
	* There wasn't much variety so it gets annoying
	* My current audio setup has a 0.5 second delay on sound, making it hard to work with when audio need good timing
	* Bottlenecking this 3.0 release
	* It may come back in a future version, but it's not the core of the game so isn't something to be focused on right now
	* Please let me know your thoughts

- Disabled Anyalitics

New Art:
- Air particles
- Squishy jumping sounds (bit too echoey atm)
- Sky background (needs some tweaks)
- Hand (quick sketch, needs doing properly)

Fixes:

- Frogs would get stuck on flat surfaces
- Clouds would pop up/disappear without playing the animation properly (occasionally I still see them do this ;~;)
- So many bugs caused by adding multiplayer functionality

Known Issues:

- Frogs occasionally launch forwards but not up with particular timed jumps
- Frogs can get stuck in objects when respawning
- Aligaytors will sometimes be launched the other way from what you'd expect when you land on them
	* I think this is unity having some janky physics so I'm not sure I can fix this one properly
