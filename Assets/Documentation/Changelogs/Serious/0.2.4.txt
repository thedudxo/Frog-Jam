Changes:

- the way the game checks if you can jump or not is done differently, but should feel the same. (It now checks if your moving)

- Frog sillouette simplified, hence frog collider is simpler too. Less getting stuck on things.

- Wave has a bit of a jiggle to it, and no longer stops when you die. also features more wave.

- Checkpoints have non copyright infringing names.

- Organised sprite layers so I know what should be drawn over what
