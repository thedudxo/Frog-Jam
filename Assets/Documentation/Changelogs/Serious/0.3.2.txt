New Art:

- Straws come in more colours

- Reworked sky art. It's now a physical object in the level, which makes more sence in Frog Jam's setting.

Changes:

- Moved the lilly pad before flippy birb forward slightly. It was possible to fall through the gap there if you fell in at an angle, which was unintended.

Fixes:

- The stop sign would only change text when you restarted the scene (via the main menu)

- Wave sprites were rendering underneath things they should have been on top of

- Todays catch didn't count deaths in front of the boat

- Todays catch font size while displaying "Heaps" was too large

- Respawining without changing which two splits you were between would cause the next split to be marked as passed, without actually having a time. this would, most notably, cause the end screen stats to display a huge number as the sum of splits.

Known Issues:

- Frogs can get stuck in objects when respawning
