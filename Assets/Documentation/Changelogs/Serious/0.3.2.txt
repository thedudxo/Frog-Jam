Changes:

- Refactored/optimised code for wave/frog pursuits
- Moved the lilly pad before flippy birb forward slightly. It was possible to fall through the gap there if you fell in at an angle, which was unintended.

Fixes:

- The stop sign would only change text when you restarted the scene (via the main menu)
- Wave sprites were rendering underneath things they should have been on top of
- Todays catch didn't count deaths in front of the boat
