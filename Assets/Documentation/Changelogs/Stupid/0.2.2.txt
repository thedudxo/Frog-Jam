Changes:

- Frog colliders are a little more fair and are always within the frog, As one must find the true frog within themselves.

- removed some old scripts from the project that were never used. this doesn't affect you, sou you just wasted your time reading that line. mwuahahhaa

- Respawning on the starting platform will now cause a full reset. this should reduce confusion when the wave starts "spawning" next to you.
