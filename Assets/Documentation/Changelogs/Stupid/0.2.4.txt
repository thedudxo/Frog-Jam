===============

A "we've made changes to our privacy statement" email:

- the way the game checks if you can jump or not is done differently, but should feel the same. (It now checks if your moving, so slow down you dam spastic)

- simply slick phill sillouette simplified, so slick phill collider should show simpler somewhat. sticky stuck on static stacks less.

- added JELL-O to the wave, and gave it a hall pass. also features more wave.

- Checkpoint names wont upset the man anymore. usualy I'd stick it to the man, but I guess he wins this one.

- got my crap together so I know what should be shown overtop of what

- ran the changelogs theough as shpel cekcer

===============

BOOOOB TH E BUILLLD ER:

- Bugs I created whilst doing this that nobody will ever know about. except woody, he knows about some of them. like, 2 of them. there was way more than 2.

- Jump jam would remain at a consitent conscistency when bilogical shutdown was achieved. (the stronkness of your jumpy doenst undo when you ded)

===============

I have issues:

- data privacy button may not work on html, and I have no idea why. who cares anyway, unless you own a tinfoil hat.

- Phill can sometimes jump in the air just after respawning, and I have no idea why. chill phill. actually nevermind i fixed that. so this is kinda in the wrong menu.

- Phill gets stuck on flat ground occasionaly, and I have no idea whyâ€‹. CHILL LESS PHILL THE WAVE IS COMING OH GOD PHILL WHY



- SOMEBODY BROKE THE JUKEBOX
