0.2.4

New Features:
- Contextual Music. Origonal, Short and annoying after a while but suitable for prototyping the concept.
- Jump Power Bar

New Art:
- Stop sign
- Floppy Birb Art
- Plumber pipes
- Phill Art


Changes:
- the way the game checks if you can jump or not is done differently, but should feel the same. (It now checks if your moving)
- Frog sillouette simplified, hence frog collider is simpler too. Less getting stuck on things.
- Wave has a bit of a jiggle to it, and no longer stops when you die. also features more wave.
- Checkpoints have non copyright infringing names.
- Organised sprite layers so I know what should be drawn over what

Fixes:

Known Issues:
- data privacy button may not work on html and I have no idea why ;~;
- Phill can sometimes jump in the air just after respawning


0.2.3

New Features:

- Anyalitics
- Opt-Out of anaylitics

Fixes:
- the game doesn't 'really' play anymore when the win screen pops up.

- sound should now work on HTML

- activating the "assassins creed" checkpoint and not surviving shouldn't happen now.

Changes:

0.2.2

New Features:
- pop  sound effect when you Respawn.
- pffft sound effect when you die.
- Speedrun checkpoints and timer.
- Camera smoothly follows Phill around.
- Progress lost shown on the progress bar
- green "blood" effect over the screen when you die.

Changes:
- Frog colliders are a little more fair and are always within the frog.
- removed some old scripts from the project that were never used. 
- Respawning on the starting platform will now cause a full reset. this should reduce confusion when the wave starts "spawning" next to you.

Known Issues:

- The game keeps playing when the win screen pops up

- It's possible to activate the "assassins creed" checkpoint and not survive the jump.
