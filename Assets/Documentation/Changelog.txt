0.2.4 - Mostly music

Feature Creep:
- Contextual Music that changes to your every move, like that weird guy out your window in a trenchcoat.
- super AWESOME Jump POWER METER 9000+
- fluffy poofs, totaly not fake.
- a certificate of approval when you do the good, direct from the mayor themself.

New Doodles:
- stahhpy stoop no gooo sign
- Floppy Bib drawing, totaly origanal character
- mario pipes stolen fresh outta italy (that was a lie, I got them from the flappy sky)
- litteraly the dumbest frog you've ever seen ... (cant spell dumbest without BEST)
- fluffy poofs, popsicle sticks not included. use supplied straws instead.
- "crispy" fish boap - WIP obviously

a "weve made changes to our privacy statement" email:
- the way the game checks if you can jump or not is done differently, but should feel the same. (It now checks if your moving, so slow down you fucking spastic)
- simply slick phill sillouette simplified, so slick phill collider should show simpler somewhat. sticky stuck on static stacks less.
- added JELL-O to the wave, and gave it a hall pass. also features more wave.
- Checkpoint names wont upset the man anymore. usualy I'd stick it to the man, but I guess he wins this one.
- got my shit together so I know what should be shown overtop of what

BOOOOB TH E BUILLLD ER:
- Bugs I created whilst doing this that nobody will ever know about. except woody, he knows about some of them. like, 2 of them. there was way more than 2.

I have issues:
- data privacy button may not work on html, and I have no idea why. who cares anyway, unless you own a tinfoil hat.
- Phill can sometimes jump in the air just after respawning, and I have no idea why. chill phill. 
- Phill gets stuck on flat ground occasionaly, and I have no idea whyâ€‹. CHILL LESS PHILL THE WAVE IS COMING OH GOD PHILL WHY



0.2.3 - Pretty much just fixing last versions "known issues".

New Features:
- Main Menu for main menuing. features this list of features.
- Analytics, so i knows what chu up2 dog
- Ability to Opt-Out of analytics, tinfoil hat not included

Fixes:

- the game doesn't 'really' play anymore when the win screen pops up. *warranty void if this is just a series of cheap hacks*

- sound should now work on HTML. I promise there's no "RIP headphones" section.

- activating the "assassins creed" checkpoint when you didn't safely land in a conveniently placed cart of hay shouldn't happen now.

Changes:
- Made colliders more fair and accurate (again). You can now speedrun the "flappy bird" checkpoint to 10s, I think less is still possible.

- Removed Herobrine



0.2.2

New Features:

- "pop"  sound "effect" when you Respawn. *warranty void if its just a dude making a pop sound with his lips*

- "pffft" sound "effect" when you die.  *warranty void if previous warranty was void*

- Speedrun checkpoints and timer. Sonic not included.

- Camera smoothly follows Phill around. Phill is the name of the frog.

- somewhat unnoticeable red bar shows you how much progress you loose, just to make you feel worse.

- green "blood" effect over the screen when you die.

Changes:
- Frog colliders are a little more fair and are always within the frog, As one must find the true frog within themselves.

- removed some old scripts from the project that were never used. this doesn't affect you, sou you just wasted your time reading that line. mwuahahhaa

- Respawning on the starting platform will now cause a full reset. this should reduce confusion when the wave starts "spawning" next to you.

- Most fonts aren't default anymore. Non Bulk Standard.  Bog Standard? Frog standard. Frog banner? The font's don't hold frog banners anymore.

Known Issues:

- The game keeps playing when the win screen pops up

- It's possible to activate the "assassins creed" checkpoint and not survive the jump.

- sound doesn't work in HTML for some reason ;~;
