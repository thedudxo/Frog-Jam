0.2.3 - Pretty much just fixing last versions "known issues".

New Features:
- Main Menu for main menuing. features this list of features.
- Anyalitics, so i knows what chu up2 dog
- Ablility to Opt-Out of anaylitics, tinfoil hat not included

Fixes:

- the game doesn't 'really' play anymore when the win screen pops up. *warranty void if this is just a series of cheap hacks*

- sound should now work on HTML. I promise theres no "RIP headphones" section.

- activating the "assassins creed" checkpoint when you didn't safely land in a conveniently placed cart of hay shouldn't happen now.

Changes:
- Made colliders more fair and accurate (again). You can now speedrun the "flappy bird" checkpoint to 10s, I think less is still possible.

- Removed Herobrine



0.2.2

New Features:

- "pop"  sound "effect" when you Respawn. *warranty void if its just a dude making a pop sound with his lips*

- "pffft" sound "effect" when you die.  *warranty void if previous warranty was void*

- Speedrun checkpoints and timer. Sonic not included.

- Camera smoothly follows Phill around. Phill is the name of the frog.

- somewhat unnoticeable red bar shows you how much progress you loose, just to make you feel worse.

- green "blood" effect over the screen when you die.

Changes:
- Frog colliders are a little more fair and are always within the frog, As one must find the true frog within themselves.

- removed some old scripts from the project that were never used. this doesn't affect you, sou you just wasted your time reading that line. mwuahahhaa

- Respawning on the starting platform will now cause a full reset. this should reduce confusion when the wave starts "spawning" next to you.

- Most fonts aren't default anymore. Non Bulk Standard.  Bog Standard? Frog standard. Frog banner? The font's don't hold frog banners anymore.

Known Issues:

- The game keeps playing when the win screen pops up

- It's possible to activate the "assassins creed" checkpoint and not survive the jump.

- sound doesn't work in HTML for some reason ;~;
