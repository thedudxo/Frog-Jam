0.2.2
New Features
- Particles: When you die, and respawn. So all the time.
- "pop" sound "effect" when you die. *warranty void if its just a dude making a pop sound with his lips*
- Speedrun chekpoints and timer. Sonic not included.
- Camera smoothly follows Phill around. Phill is the name of the frog.
- somewhat unoticicable red bar shows you how much progress you loose, just to make you feel worse.
- green "blood" effect over the screen when you die.

New Bugs
- that green blood effect doesn't work.

Changes
- Frog colliders are a little more fair and are always within the frog. one must find the true frog within themselves.
- removed some old scripts from the project that were never used. this doesn't affect you, sou you just wasted your time reading that line. mwuahahhaa
- Respawning on the starting platform will now cause a full reset. this should reduce confusion when the wave starts "spawning" next to you.
